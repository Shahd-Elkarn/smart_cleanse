Data Quality Analysis and Cleaning Tool
ðŸŒŸ Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based interactive tool designed to assist in exploring, cleaning, and analyzing datasets. Whether you're dealing with Excel (.xlsx) or CSV files, this tool provides a user-friendly interface for performing common data quality tasks, advanced transformations, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

âœ¨ Features
1. Data Exploration
Upload .xlsx or .csv datasets.
View the dataset: Quickly inspect the data.
Get dataset info: View details about columns, data types, and memory usage.
Descriptive statistics: Summarize your data with measures like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
2. Data Transformation
Rename columns to make them more meaningful.
Convert column data types to suit your needs.
3. Handle Missing Values
Automatically identify missing values in the dataset.
Choose how to handle missing data:
Drop rows/columns.
Fill with mean, median, or mode.
4. Handle Duplicates
Detect and remove duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.
5. Outlier Detection & Handling
Identify outliers using statistical methods.
Choose how to address them (e.g., removal or replacement).
6. Data Visualization
Select columns to visualize with various chart options.
Display the correlation matrix to analyze relationships between variables.
7. Interactive RAG (Red-Amber-Green) Assistant
An integrated AI chatbot (powered by Ollama) for querying your dataset.
Ask questions about your dataset to gain insights and recommendations.
8. Download Cleaned Dataset
After making transformations and cleaning the data, download the updated dataset for further use.
